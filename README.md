# Stock-Prices-using-a-BOT

Hello!

So today, I am rather excited to showcase this jupyter notebook of mine. It does so many things in such small number of code lines that a non coder like me cannot believe. 

1. What this "BOT" does is, asks you if you want to see the list of companies that the BOT can fetch the Share market prices for.
2. If you say yes, it shows the list. If you say no, It asks you to enter a Sr. No.
3. Once you see the list and enter the Sr. No. of the company you want to see the stock price of it goes to the next step.
4. If fetches the Latest Stock Price of that specific company from the Economic Times Website and displays it infront of you. 

It also checks if the answer you have entered is right or wrong. If it is right, only then it continues else it asks you again and again.

Have fun with this simple yet amazing little code. 

See you tomorrow! Cheers!
